# ResearchVault 🦞

**The local-first orchestration engine for high-velocity AI research.**

ResearchVault is a local-first state manager and orchestration framework for long-running investigations. It lets you persist projects, findings, evidence, and automation state into a local SQLite "Vault".

Vault is built CLI-first to close the loop between planning, ingestion, verification, and synthesis.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

ResearchVault is designed with a **Local-First, Privacy-First** posture:

*   **Local Persistence**: All research data stays on your machine in a local SQLite database (~/.researchvault/research_vault.db). No telemetry or auto-sync.
*   **SSRF Protection**: Strict internal network blocking by default. The tool resolves DNS and blocks private/local/link-local IPs (RFC1918, 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254, etc.).
*   **Network Transparency**: Outbound connections are limited to user-requested scuttling or Brave Search API (if configured).
*   **Zero Auto-Start**: No background processes or servers start during installation. Services must be explicitly invoked from `scripts/services/`.
*   **Restricted Model Invocation**: The `disable-model-invocation: true` flag prevents the AI from autonomously triggering side-effects without a direct user prompt.

## 🚀 Installation

### Standard (Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠️ Key Workflows

### 1. Project Management
```bash
python scripts/vault.py init --id "ai-research" --name "AI Research" --objective "Monitor 2026 trends"
```

### 2. Multi-Source Ingestion
```bash
python scripts/vault.py scuttle "https://example.com" --id "ai-research"
```

### 3. Synthesis & Verification
```bash
python scripts/vault.py synthesize --id "ai-research"
python scripts/vault.py verify run --id "ai-research"
```

### 4. Optional Services (Manual Opt-in)
*   **MCP Server**: `python scripts/services/mcp_server.py`
*   **Watchdog**: `python scripts/services/watchdog.py`

## 📦 Dependencies

*   `requests` & `beautifulsoup4`: Targeted web ingestion.
*   `rich`: CLI output formatting.
*   `mcp`: Standard protocol for agent-tool communication.
*   `pytest`: Local integrity verification.
