## Examples

### Find elementary schools near a home
```bash
./scripts/school-finder.sh '{"query": "elementary schools", "lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.0060, "radius": 1600}'
```

### Find high schools in a suburb
```bash
./scripts/school-finder.sh '{"query": "high schools in Naperville Illinois", "limit": 10}'
```

### Find universities near downtown
```bash
./scripts/school-finder.sh '{"query": "universities and colleges", "lat": 42.3601, "lon": -71.0589, "radius": 5000}'
```

## Best Practices

- Use 1600m radius (approximately 1 mile) for elementary school searches near a home
- Use larger radius (3000-5000m) for high school and university searches
- Specify school type in the query for more targeted results (e.g., "elementary schools", "high schools", "universities")
- Combine with the `real-estate` skill for a complete neighborhood evaluation
- Combine with the `route` skill to calculate walking or driving times from home to school
- Combine with the `relationship` skill to check distances between home and multiple schools
