# Security Monitor

Real-time security monitoring with threat intelligence from ClawHavoc research, daily automated scans, web dashboard, and Telegram alerting for OpenClaw.

## Commands

### /security-scan
Run a comprehensive 32-point security scan:
1. Known C2 IPs (ClawHavoc: 91.92.242.x, 95.92.242.x, 54.91.154.110)
2. AMOS stealer / AuthTool markers
3. Reverse shells & backdoors (bash, python, perl, ruby, php, lua)
4. Credential exfiltration endpoints (webhook.site, pipedream, ngrok, etc.)
5. Crypto wallet targeting (seed phrases, private keys, exchange APIs)
6. Curl-pipe / download attacks
7. Sensitive file permission audit
8. Skill integrity hash verification
9. SKILL.md shell injection patterns (Prerequisites-based attacks)
10. Memory poisoning detection (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, IDENTITY.md)
11. Base64 obfuscation detection (glot.io-style payloads)
12. External binary downloads (.exe, .dmg, .pkg, password-protected ZIPs)
13. Gateway security configuration audit
14. WebSocket origin validation (CVE-2026-25253)
15. Known malicious publisher detection (hightower6eu, etc.)
16. Sensitive environment/credential file leakage
17. DM policy audit (open/wildcard channel access)
18. Tool policy / elevated tools audit
19. Sandbox configuration check
20. mDNS/Bonjour exposure detection
21. Session & credential file permissions
22. Persistence mechanism scan (LaunchAgents, crontabs, systemd)
23. Plugin/extension security audit
24. Log redaction settings audit
25. Reverse proxy localhost trust bypass detection
26. Exec-approvals configuration audit (CVE-2026-25253 exploit chain)
27. Docker container security (root, socket mount, privileged mode)
28. Node.js version / CVE-2026-21636 permission model bypass
29. Plaintext credential detection in config files
30. VS Code extension trojan detection (fake ClawdBot extensions)
31. Internet exposure detection (non-loopback gateway binding)
32. MCP server security audit (tool poisoning, prompt injection)

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/scan.sh
```

Exit codes: 0=SECURE, 1=WARNINGS, 2=COMPROMISED

### /security-dashboard
Display a security overview with process trees via witr.

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/dashboard.sh
```

### /security-network
Monitor network connections and check against IOC database.

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/network-check.sh
```

### /security-remediate
Scan-driven remediation: runs `scan.sh`, skips CLEAN checks, and executes per-check remediation scripts for each WARNING/CRITICAL finding. Includes 32 individual scripts covering file permissions, exfiltration domain blocking, tool deny lists, gateway hardening, sandbox configuration, credential auditing, and more.

```bash
# Full scan + remediate (interactive)
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/remediate.sh

# Auto-approve all fixes
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/remediate.sh --yes

# Dry run (preview)
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/remediate.sh --dry-run

# Remediate a single check
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/remediate.sh --check 7 --dry-run

# Run all 32 remediation scripts (skip scan)
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/remediate.sh --all
```

Flags:
- `--yes` / `-y` — Skip confirmation prompts (auto-approve all fixes)
- `--dry-run` — Show what would be fixed without making changes
- `--check N` — Run remediation for check N only (skip scan)
- `--all` — Run all 32 remediation scripts without scanning first

Exit codes: 0=fixes applied, 1=some fixes failed, 2=nothing to fix

### /security-setup-telegram
Register a Telegram chat for daily security alerts.

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/telegram-setup.sh [chat_id]
```

## Web Dashboard

**URL**: `http://<vm-ip>:18800`

Dark-themed browser dashboard with auto-refresh, on-demand scanning, donut charts, process tree visualization, network monitoring, and scan history timeline.

### Service Management
```bash
launchctl list | grep security-dashboard
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.security-dashboard.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.security-dashboard.plist
```

## IOC Database

Threat intelligence files in `ioc/`:
- `c2-ips.txt` - Known command & control IP addresses
- `malicious-domains.txt` - Payload hosting and exfiltration domains
- `file-hashes.txt` - Known malicious file SHA-256 hashes
- `malicious-publishers.txt` - Known malicious ClawHub publishers
- `malicious-skill-patterns.txt` - Malicious skill naming patterns

## Daily Automated Scan

Cron job at 06:00 UTC with Telegram alerts. Install:
```bash
crontab -l | { cat; echo "0 6 * * * $HOME/.openclaw/workspace/skills/security-monitor/scripts/daily-scan-cron.sh"; } | crontab -
```
