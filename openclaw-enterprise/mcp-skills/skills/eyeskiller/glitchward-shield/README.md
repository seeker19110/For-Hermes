# LLM Shield for OpenClaw

Protect your OpenClaw AI assistant from prompt injection attacks with Glitchward LLM Shield.

## Why You Need This

OpenClaw has powerful capabilities:
- Browser control
- File system access
- Shell command execution
- Personal data access

A prompt injection attack could exploit these to:
- Exfiltrate your files
- Execute malicious commands
- Access your accounts
- Leak your private data

LLM Shield validates all incoming messages **before** they reach the AI, blocking attacks in real-time.

## Installation

### 1. Get Your Free API Token

Sign up at [glitchward.com/shield](https://glitchward.com/shield) and get your API token from Settings.

Free tier includes 1,000 requests/month - enough for personal use.

### 2. Install the Skill

Copy `llm-shield-skill.js` to your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
cp llm-shield-skill.js ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

### 3. Configure Environment

export SHIELD_THRESHOLD="0.5"    # 0.0 - 1.0 risk threshold
export SHIELD_VERBOSE="false"    # Enable debug logging
```

### 4. Restart OpenClaw

Restart your OpenClaw instance to load the skill.
