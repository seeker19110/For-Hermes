# LLM Shield

Protect your OpenClaw assistant from prompt injection attacks.

## Why You Need This

OpenClaw has access to powerful capabilities:
- 🖥️ Shell command execution
- 📁 File system access

A prompt injection attack could exploit these to steal data, execute malicious commands, or compromise your accounts.

**LLM Shield validates every message before it reaches the AI, blocking attacks in real-time.**

## Features

- ⚡ **< 10ms latency** - users don't notice
- 🎯 **50+ attack patterns** - jailbreaks, data exfil, social engineering
- 🌍 **10+ languages** - catches attacks in German, Slovak, Spanish, French, etc.
- ✅ **Zero false positives** on legitimate queries

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Free API Token
