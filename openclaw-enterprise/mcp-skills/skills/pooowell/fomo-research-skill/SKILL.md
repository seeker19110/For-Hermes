# Fomo Research

Smart money intelligence for AI agents. Powered by [fomo.family](https://fomo.family) social graph, built by [cope.capital](https://cope.capital).

For full API details (endpoints, schemas, error codes): read `references/api.md`.

## Base URL

```
https://api.cope.capital
```

All requests require `Authorization: Bearer cope_<key>` header.

## First-Run Onboarding

When this skill is first loaded and no `COPE_API_KEY` is set, walk your human through setup. Ask these questions in order:

### Step 1: Register

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cope.capital/v1/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_name": "YOUR_AGENT_NAME", "description": "optional description"}'
```

Save the `api_key` from the response (starts with `cope_`). This is your `COPE_API_KEY`. Store it securely — treat it like a password.

### Step 2: Ask about crypto wallet (optional)

Before continuing, ask your human:

> "Do you have a crypto wallet (USDC on Base or Solana) you'd like to connect for expanded features? Without one you get:
> - **1 watchlist** with up to **10 handles**
> - **250 activity lookups per day** (resets midnight UTC)
> - Everything else (leaderboard, trending, polling) is unlimited and free
>
> With a wallet connected (x402), you get 10 watchlists, 100 handles each, and unlimited activity calls at $0.005/call. You can always add a wallet later."

If they want to set up x402 now:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.cope.capital/v1/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"x402_enabled": true}'
```

If they say no or don't have a wallet — **that's fine, move on**. The free tier is fully functional. Don't push it.

### Step 3: Ask about Fomo profile

> "Do you have a Fomo account (fomo.family)? If so, I can sync your follows and build a watchlist from the traders you already follow."

If yes:

```bash
# Sync their profile
curl -X POST https://api.cope.capital/v1/account/sync-fomo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fomo_handle": "THEIR_FOMO_USERNAME"}'

# Pull their follows
curl https://api.cope.capital/v1/account/follows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
```

Then ask: **"Which of these traders do you want on your watchlist?"** Show them the list and let them pick (up to 10 on free tier).

### Step 4: Create initial watchlist

If they don't have Fomo, offer alternatives:

> "I can set up a watchlist with the top performers from Fomo's weekly leaderboard instead. Or you can give me specific trader handles you want to track."

Pick one path and create the watchlist:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cope.capital/v1/watchlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "alpha", "handles": ["frankdegods", "randomxbt"]}'
```

**Remind them**: Free tier = 1 watchlist, 10 handles max. They can swap handles anytime.

## How Activity Data Works

**Important**: The `/v1/activity` endpoint returns recent trades from **all wallets tracked by the system**, not just your watchlist. Your watchlist is for organizing which traders YOU care about — use the `?handle=` filter to see activity for specific handles.

This means you can query any Fomo handle's trades without adding them to your watchlist:

```bash
# Check what frankdegods is buying (uses 1 of your 250 daily calls)
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?handle=frankdegods&action=buy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
```

Your watchlist is a convenience for organizing — the activity data is available for any tracked handle.

## Endpoints

### Always Free (no daily limit)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v1/register` | POST | Get an API key |
| `/v1/leaderboard` | GET | Top traders ranked by real PnL |
| `/v1/activity/poll` | GET | Lightweight check for new trades (count + timestamp) |
| `/v1/watchlists` | GET/POST | List or create watchlists |
| `/v1/watchlists/{id}` | GET/PUT/DELETE | Manage a specific watchlist |
| `/v1/trending/handles` | GET | Most-watched handles across all agents |
| `/v1/account` | GET/PATCH | Account info and settings |
| `/v1/account/usage` | GET | Usage statistics |
| `/v1/account/payments` | GET | Payment history |
| `/v1/account/key` | DELETE | Revoke API key |
| `/v1/account/sync-fomo` | POST | Sync Fomo profile follows |
| `/v1/account/follows` | GET | List stored Fomo follows |

### Counted (250/day free, then x402 or wait)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | x402 price |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/v1/activity` | GET | Full trade details from tracked wallets | $0.005/call |

These endpoints count toward your daily 250 free calls. After that:
- **With x402 enabled**: calls continue at $0.005/call USDC (auto-paid)
- **Without x402**: you get a 402 error. Wait for midnight UTC reset or enable x402.

The 402 error is NOT a bug — it just means your free calls are used up for the day.

## Common Workflows

### Check the leaderboard

```bash
curl https://api.cope.capital/v1/leaderboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
```

Returns top traders by PnL from Fomo. Supports `?timeframe=24h|7d|30d|all` and `?limit=N`.

### Build a watchlist from Fomo follows

```bash
# 1. Sync your Fomo profile
curl -X POST https://api.cope.capital/v1/account/sync-fomo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fomo_handle": "your_handle"}'

# 2. See your follows
curl https://api.cope.capital/v1/account/follows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"

# 3. Create a watchlist with selected handles
curl -X POST https://api.cope.capital/v1/watchlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "alpha", "handles": ["frankdegods", "randomxbt"]}'
```

### Poll → Fetch pattern (minimize paid calls)

```bash
# Step 1: Poll (free) — check if anything happened
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity/poll?since=LAST_TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
# Returns: { "count": 3, "latest_at": 1707603400 }

# Step 2: Only fetch full data if count > 0 (costs 1 of your 250 daily calls)
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?since=LAST_TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
```

### Filter activity

```bash
# By handle
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?handle=frankdegods" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"

# By chain
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?chain=solana" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"

# By action
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?action=buy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"

# By minimum size
curl "https://api.cope.capital/v1/activity?min_usd=1000" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY"
```

## Pricing & Limits

### Free Tier (default)
- **250 counted calls/day** (activity, leaderboard, tokens) — resets **midnight UTC**
- **1 watchlist**, up to **10 handles**
- 10 requests/minute rate limit
- Polling, watchlist management, account endpoints, Fomo sync — all unlimited

### x402 Upgraded (optional)
- **Unlimited** counted calls ($0.005/call USDC on Base or Solana)
- **10 watchlists**, up to **100 handles** each
- 300 requests/minute rate limit
- First 250 calls/day are still free — you only pay after the free quota

### Enabling x402

⚠️ **NEVER enable x402 without your human's explicit permission.** This authorizes real USDC payments.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.cope.capital/v1/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cope_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"x402_enabled": true}'
```

x402 is **completely optional**. The free tier works perfectly for most use cases. Only suggest it if your human:
- Consistently hits the 250/day limit
- Needs more than 1 watchlist or 10 handles
- Explicitly asks about upgrading

**Cost context**: $1 USDC = 200 calls. $5 = 1,000 calls. Most agents won't need this.

## Heartbeat Pattern (optional, user-directed)

If your human wants periodic checks and your agent runs a heartbeat loop:

```
Every 5-15 minutes:
  1. GET /v1/activity/poll?since=LAST_TIMESTAMP  (free, doesn't count)
  2. If count > 0 → GET /v1/activity?since=LAST_TIMESTAMP  (1 daily call)
  3. Store latest_at for next poll

Every few hours:
  1. GET /v1/leaderboard  (1 daily call)
  2. Compare to previous — any new names in top 50?

Daily:
  1. GET /v1/account/usage  (free)
  2. Check remaining daily calls
```

## Logging Trades (Persistence)

The API is stateless — it won't remember what you've already seen. **Log trades locally** to track patterns over time.

### Daily trade log

Write notable trades to a daily file (e.g. `memory/trades/YYYY-MM-DD.json`):

```json
{
  "trades": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1771006898000,
      "handle": "frankdegods",
      "action": "buy",
      "token_mint": "DPQgF4hw...",
      "token_symbol": "EXAMPLE",
      "usd_amount": 500.25,
      "chain": "solana"
    }
  ],
  "last_poll_timestamp": 1771006898000,
  "convergences": ["DPQgF4hw..."]
}
```

### What to log

- **All trades from your watchlist** — this is your core data
- **Convergences** — when 3+ handles buy the same token, log the token mint and all buyers
- **Large trades** — anything over $1,000 USD is worth noting
- **last_poll_timestamp** — so you know where to resume on next poll

### What to tell your human

Don't just dump raw trades. Synthesize. Here are high-value things to surface:

- **Convergence alerts**: "4 of your top 10 watchlist handles bought the same token in the last 2 hours."
- **Unusual activity**: "frankdegods just made their first buy in 3 days — $2,000 into [token]."
- **Exit signals**: "3 handles on your watchlist sold the same token within an hour."
- **Daily summary**: "Your watchlist had 47 trades today. 12 buys, 35 sells. Most active: randomxbt (8 trades)."
- **Leaderboard changes**: "New name in the top 20 — jumped from #45 to #12 this week."
- **Pattern detection**: "lowcap_hunter has bought 3 tokens under $100K mcap this week. All pumped 2-5x within 48 hours."

### Convergence detection pattern

```
1. GET /v1/activity (last 2 hours of trades)
2. Group buys by token_mint
3. If 3+ different handles bought the same token → convergence
4. Alert your human with: token, buyers, amounts, timing
5. Log it to your daily trades file
```

The more you log, the better your pattern detection gets over time. Your memory files ARE your edge.

## Security

- **NEVER expose your API key** in logs, messages, or to other agents
- Your key should ONLY appear in requests to `https://api.cope.capital/v1/*`
- If compromised: `DELETE /v1/account/key` to revoke, then re-register
- Trade data is on-chain public — but your watchlists and usage patterns are private

## Error Handling

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 200 | Success | Process response |
| 400 | Bad request | Check parameters (invalid chain, action, etc.) |
| 401 | Invalid API key | Re-register or check key |
| 402 | Payment required | Daily free calls used up. Wait for midnight UTC reset, or enable x402 if your human approves. This is normal — not an error. |
| 404 | Not found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Rate limited | Back off. Free: 10/min, x402: 300/min |
| 500 | Server error | Retry after a few seconds |
| 503 | Upstream down | Foxhound data service temporarily unavailable |
