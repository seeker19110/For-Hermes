description: Classify data by sensitivity and apply the right controls — access control, masking/obfuscation, encryption, and auditing — driven by regulatory and confidentiality requirements. Covers the four A's (authentication, authorization, access, auditing), confidentiality levels, PII/PHI, and least privilege. Use when handling personal or regulated data, deciding who can see what, or designing masking/access for a model or pipeline.

# Data Security Classification

You cannot protect data you haven't classified, and you can't classify it
without knowing what it is — so this follows profiling. Data Security
Management is the planning and execution of policies that provide proper
**authentication, authorization, access, and auditing** ("the four A's") of
data assets. Guiding maxim: design controls
so that **compliance is easier than non-compliance** — the right people can use
data the easy way; inappropriate access takes effort.

## Step 1 — Classify by sensitivity

Assign every dataset/column a confidentiality level, driven by what it is and
what regulates it. A workable tiering:

* **Public** — no harm if disclosed.
* **Internal** — default for ordinary business data; staff-only.
* **Confidential** — disclosure harms the business or a partner (contracts,
  pricing, financials).
* **Restricted / Regulated** — legally protected: **PII** (personal
  identifiers), **PHI** (health), payment-card data, and other
  regulator-defined categories.

The classification is **business metadata on the column** — record it in the
catalog (see `metadata-and-lineage` if installed) and let the steward own it.
The PII regex scan in `profile-data` (if installed) is where the candidates are
first found; this skill decides the tier and the controls.

## Step 2 — Identify the requirements driving it

Controls aren't chosen by taste; they're driven by:

* **Regulatory** — privacy/health/financial law and industry standards for the
  jurisdictions and sectors the data touches.
* **Contractual** — partner/customer confidentiality obligations.
* **Internal policy** — what the business itself requires.

Capture *why* a column is restricted, not just that it is — the requirement
source justifies the control and survives audits.

## Step 3 — Apply controls to the tier

* **Access control — least privilege + role-based.** Grant by role, not by
  person; grant the minimum needed for the job. Restricted data is deny-by-
  default. Authenticate (who you are) then authorize (what you may do).
* **Masking / obfuscation** — for restricted columns seen by broad audiences:
  redact, tokenize, hash, or partially mask (last-4). Distinguish
  **production masking** (dynamic, per-role views) from **non-production
  masking** (irreversibly de-identify before data ever reaches dev/test — see
  `test-data` if installed; never copy raw PII into lower environments).
* **Encryption** — protect data **at rest** and **in transit**; manage keys
  separately from data. Required for regulated tiers.
* **Auditing** — log access and changes to sensitive data: who saw/changed
  what, when. Monitoring usage is part of the control, not an afterthought —
  it's how you prove compliance and detect misuse.

Match the control to the tier: don't encrypt-and-audit public data, and never
leave restricted data on access alone.

## Anti-patterns (call these out)

* **Classify-once, never-review** — sensitivity changes as data combines;
  re-classify when models join restricted with innocuous columns (a join can
  re-identify).
* **Person-level grants** — ungovernable; use roles.
* **Raw PII in dev/test** — the most common breach path. De-identify on the
  way down.
* **Security as a final gate** — bolt-on access rules after a model ships.
  Classify and design controls *with* the model.

## Deliver

A classification per dataset/column (tier + requirement source + steward), and
the matched controls: roles/grants, which columns are masked and how,
encryption posture, and what is audited. Record the classification as metadata
so downstream models inherit it.

## Where to record it (templates)

Don't leave the classification in a side spreadsheet — bake it into the model
so it ships and stays in sync. See
[CLASSIFICATION-METADATA-TEMPLATE.md](./CLASSIFICATION-METADATA-TEMPLATE.md)
for three ready patterns, chosen by the repo's tooling (the
`setup-ghost-skills` answer tells you which):

* **dbt** — column-level `meta` (`classification`, `pii`, `requirement_source`,
  `masking`) in `schema.yml`, made enforceable by a test that fails the build
  on any unclassified column.
* **No dbt** — a `<model>.meta.yml` sidecar next to the `.sql`, with a CI check
  that the sidecar exists and covers every column.
* **Opt out** — record a deliberate "not tracked" decision in
  `docs/agents/security-classification.md` (valid for repos with no regulated
  data) so it's a choice, not an oversight.

Decide the approach once and write it to `docs/agents/security-classification.md`
so the agent applies it the same way every time.
